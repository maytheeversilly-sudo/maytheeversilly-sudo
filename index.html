                    <div class="bio-text-area">As a primordial concept, Lust has been around since the beginning of time, since the first man gazed his eyes upon a beautiful woman and thought of her as a goal to conquer. they're a conqueror. living amongst the people of their world as a warlord, they lead the strongest country on the planet, with each attack, the thrill dulls, and the lust for conquering and power becomes stronger. more fierce. </div>

                    <p class="ability-line">1: <span class="input-field"><b>Sovereign's Feast:</b> Lust designates a single enemy as the "Feast." For the next 3 turns, all damage dealt to that target by Lust and their allies is converted into a euphoric, tangible energy that fuels their dominion.<br><br>• <b>Effect:</b> Marks a single target for 3 turns. While marked, 50% of all damage the target takes is siphoned as <b>Hedonistic Charge</b>. This charge is stored collectively for Lust's party.<br>• <b>Charge Expenditure (Party):</b> Any ally (including Lust) may, as a bonus action, consume 1 stack of Hedonistic Charge to immediately heal for (1.0 x C) HP or add (0.5 x C) as bonus damage to their next attack.<br>• <b>Final Course:</b> If the marked target dies before the duration ends, Lust claims the remaining bounty, erupting with power. They gain a <b>+2.5x boost to Power and Charisma</b> for 2 turns and all remaining Hedonistic Charge is instantly converted to temporary HP for the entire party.<br>• <b>(Cooldown: 7 turns)</b></span></p>
                    <p class="ability-line">2: <span class="input-field"><b>Golden Cage of Want:</b> Lust projects an irresistible, shimmering prison of perfect fantasy tailored to a foe's deepest desires. The target is offered everything they have ever wished for, if only they would cease their struggle and indulge.<br><br>• <b>Effect:</b> Lust targets a single enemy with a M-based (10+ - +1 30+ = +2 60+ = +3 100+ = +4 1000+ = +5) saving throw.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;o <b>On a Failed Save:</b> The target is <b>Enthralled</b> for 2 turns. They are paralyzed by blissful hallucination, unable to act. At the start of each of their turns, they take (2.0 x C) + (1.0 x M) psychic damage as their life force is gently siphoned to feed the fantasy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;o <b>On a Successful Save:</b> The target resists the full fantasy but is still lured by its promise. They suffer <b>Disadvantage on all rolls</b> for 1 turn as their focus wavers, and take (1.5 x C) psychic damage.<br>• <b>Hedonistic Feedback:</b> While an enemy is Enthralled, Lust's own senses are amplified by their consumption. Lust gains <b>25% Damage Reduction</b> and their basic attacks heal them for 15% of the damage dealt.<br>• <b>(Cooldown: 5 turns. Cannot affect bosses, super-bosses, or other player characters.)</b></span></p>
                    <p class="ability-line">3: <span class="input-field"><b>Axiom of the Final Sensation (Ultimate):</b> Lust declares a singular, absolute truth: all existence culminates in sensation, and <i>they</i> are its master. They temporarily rewrite the rules of engagement on the battlefield, turning every strike, spell, and breath into an instrument of their supreme pleasure and authority.<br><br>• <b>Activation Requirement:</b> Can only be activated when at least 3 enemies are within a 30-foot radius, or after Lust has accrued 10 stacks of Hedonistic Charge from <b>Sovereign's Feast</b>.<br>• <b>Effect:</b> Lust unleashes a wave of overwhelming, sublime authority that lasts for <b>4 turns</b>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;o <b>Domain of the Senses:</b> All enemies within the 30-foot radius have their <b>Mind and Charisma stats halved</b> for the duration, overwhelmed by sensory input.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;o <b>Principle of Consumption:</b> Whenever any creature (friend or foe) within the Domain takes damage, Lust absorbs a portion of the experience. They gain a stack of <b>Vital Sensation</b>, granting them +0.5 to Power and +5 temporary HP per stack (max 10 stacks).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;o <b>Edict of Submission:</b> Lust's presence becomes utterly dominant. They may, once per turn as a free action, issue a command to a single enemy who failed their initial save. The target must spend their next action to move toward Lust or use a basic attack on their own ally (whichever is closer), as their will is subsumed by the need to please the sovereign of sensation.<br>• <b>Apex Sensation:</b> If Lust ends this transformation with 10 stacks of Vital Sensation, they undergo a moment of perfect, terrifying clarity. Their next attack within 2 turns is an <b>automatic critical hit</b> that deals an additional (5.0 x C) + (All remaining Temporary HP) as bonus true damage.<br>• <b>(Cooldown: 18 turns. The cooldown begins after the transformation ends.)</b></span></p>                    <p class="note">(These can be anything! Just so long as it's not too overpowered and exploitable.)</p>
